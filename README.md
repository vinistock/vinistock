### ðŸ‘‹ Hey 

I'm Vini and I'm a developer at [Shopify](https://shopify.com) where we are working to make commerce better for everyone!

I have a wide range of interests in software including developer tools, libraries, frameworks all the way to building products. I'm intrinsicly curious and like to learn how tech works under the hood, so I tend to get involved in many things at once.

### :rocket: Open source

I enjoy being involved with the open source community. These are the projects I contribute the most to, although you might find me coding elsewhere.
- [Sail](https://github.com/vinistock/sail)
- [Rails](https://github.com/rails/rails)

### :memo: Blog

I blog about topics that I think could help other devs in their careers. Mostly tech specific.
